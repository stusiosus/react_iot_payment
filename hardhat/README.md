# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npy hardhat compile
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js

```
